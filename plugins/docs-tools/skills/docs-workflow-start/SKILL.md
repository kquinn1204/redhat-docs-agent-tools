# Docs Workflow Start

Interactive entry point for the documentation workflow.

## Parse arguments

Same argument set as docs-orchestrator:

- `$1` — JIRA ticket ID (optional at this stage)
- `--workflow <name>` — custom workflow YAML
- `--pr <url>` — PR/MR URLs (repeatable)
- `--mkdocs` — Material for MkDocs format
- `--draft` — staging area mode
- `--repo-path <path>` — target docs repo for update-in-place
- `--repo <url-or-path>` — source code repository
- `--create-jira <PROJECT>` — create linked JIRA ticket

## Determine mode

**Pass-through mode**: If ANY `--` switches are present in the args string, invoke docs-orchestrator directly with all original arguments. Do NOT use AskUserQuestion.

```
Skill: docs-orchestrator, args: "<all original args>"
```

**Interactive mode**: If no `--` switches are present (bare invocation or just a ticket ID), proceed to the interactive input gathering below.

## Interactive input gathering

### Get ticket ID

If no ticket ID was provided in args, ask the user conversationally:

> What is the JIRA ticket ID? (e.g., PROJ-123)

The ticket ID is required for all modes.

### Call 1 — Action selection

Use AskUserQuestion with 1 question:

**What would you like to do?**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Run full workflow (Recommended) | Run the complete docs pipeline from requirements through to MR creation |
| Run specific step(s) | Run one or more individual workflow steps with prerequisites included automatically |
| Resume existing workflow | Continue a previously started workflow for this ticket |

**If "Resume existing workflow"**: Skip all remaining AskUserQuestion calls. Invoke the orchestrator with just the ticket ID:

```
Skill: docs-orchestrator, args: "<ticket>"
```

The orchestrator detects the existing progress file and resumes automatically. STOP here — do not continue to Call 2.

### Call 2 — Configuration

#### If "Run full workflow" was selected

Use AskUserQuestion with 4 questions:

**Q1: What output format should the documentation use?**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| AsciiDoc (Recommended) | Standard Red Hat documentation format |
| Material for MkDocs | Markdown-based documentation format |

**Q2: Do you have source code related to this ticket?**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Yes — I have a PR URL | A pull request or merge request URL |
| Yes — I have a repo URL or path | A repository URL or local directory path |
| No source code | Proceed without code-evidence retrieval |

**Q3: Where should the documentation be written?**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Current repo — update in place (Recommended) | Detect framework and write directly to the current repository |
| A different repo | Write to a specified repository path |
| Draft — staging area only | Write to staging area without modifying any repository |

**Q4: Create a linked JIRA ticket in another project?**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| No (Recommended) | Skip JIRA ticket creation |
| Yes | Create a linked ticket in another JIRA project |

After Call 2, proceed to [Free-text follow-ups](#free-text-follow-ups).

#### If "Run specific step(s)" was selected

Use AskUserQuestion with 1 question (multiSelect enabled):

**Which step(s) do you want to run?**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| requirements | Analyze JIRA ticket and extract documentation requirements |
| code-evidence | Retrieve code evidence from source repository |
| writing | Write documentation from an existing plan |
| technical-review | Review existing documentation for technical accuracy |

For steps not listed (planning, style-review, prepare-branch, commit, create-mr, create-jira), the user can type the step name via the "Other" option.

**Invalid step names**: If the user enters a step name via "Other" that is not recognized, the dependency resolver will report the error with a list of valid step names. Surface this error to the user and ask them to correct their selection.

After step selection, proceed to Call 3.

### Call 3 — Step-specific configuration (specific steps only)

Determine which configuration questions are relevant based on the selected steps. Only include questions that apply:

- **Format?** — include if any of these steps are selected: writing, style-review
- **Source code?** — include if code-evidence is selected
- **Placement?** — include if any of these steps are selected: writing, prepare-branch, commit, create-mr
- **Create JIRA?** — include if create-jira is selected

If no questions are relevant (e.g., user selected only requirements or technical-review), skip Call 3 entirely.

Use AskUserQuestion with only the relevant questions (1–4). The question text and options are identical to the full-workflow versions in Call 2.

After Call 3, proceed to [Free-text follow-ups](#free-text-follow-ups).

### Free-text follow-ups

Collect free-text inputs conversationally (not via AskUserQuestion) based on answers from Call 2 or Call 3. Only ask questions that are needed.

**If "Yes — I have a PR URL" was selected**:
> Enter PR/MR URL(s), one per line (press Enter twice when done):

Multiple URLs are supported. Each becomes a `--pr <url>` flag.

**If "Yes — I have a repo URL or path" was selected**:
> Enter the source repo URL or local path:

Single value. Then follow up:
> Do you also have PR URL(s) for this repo? If so, enter them one per line (press Enter twice when done). Otherwise, press Enter to skip:

This is because `--repo` and `--pr` can coexist — the PR branch gets checked out within the repo.

**If "A different repo" was selected for placement**:
> Enter the target docs repository path:

Maps to `--repo-path <path>`.

**If "Yes" was selected for Create JIRA**:
> Enter the target JIRA project key (e.g., DOCS):

Maps to `--create-jira <PROJECT>`.

## Map answers to CLI flags

Build the args string from collected answers:

| Answer | CLI flag |
|--------|----------|
| Material for MkDocs | `--mkdocs` |
| PR URL(s) | `--pr <url>` (repeat for each URL) |
| Repo URL or path | `--repo <url-or-path>` |
| Draft — staging area only | `--draft` |
| Target docs repo path | `--repo-path <path>` |
| Create JIRA = Yes | `--create-jira <PROJECT>` |

AsciiDoc format and current repo placement are defaults — no flags needed.

**Precedence**: If both `--repo-path` and `--draft` would be set, `--repo-path` wins — log a warning and omit `--draft` (matches orchestrator behavior).

## Execute: Full workflow

Invoke the orchestrator with the ticket ID and all constructed flags:

```
Skill: docs-orchestrator, args: "<ticket> <constructed flags>"
```

Example:

```
Skill: docs-orchestrator, args: "PROJ-123 --mkdocs --pr https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42 --draft"
```

## Execute: Specific step(s)

When running individual steps, dependencies are resolved automatically and each step skill is invoked directly.

### 1. Resolve base path

```bash
TICKET_LOWER=$(echo "<ticket>" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
BASE_PATH="$(cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)" && pwd)/artifacts/${TICKET_LOWER}"
mkdir -p "$BASE_PATH"
```

### 2. Resolve the YAML path

Determine which workflow YAML to use:

```bash
if [[ -f ".claude/docs-workflow.yaml" ]]; then
  YAML_PATH=".claude/docs-workflow.yaml"
else
  YAML_PATH="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/docs-orchestrator/defaults/docs-workflow.yaml"
fi
```

### 3. Compute execution plan

Run the dependency resolver:

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/resolve_steps.py \
  --yaml "$YAML_PATH" \
  --steps <selected-step-names...> \
  --base-path "$BASE_PATH"
```

If the script exits with code 1, the user entered an invalid step name. Read the `error` field and `valid_steps` list from the JSON output and tell the user:

> Step name "\<name\>" is not recognized. Valid steps are: \<valid_steps list\>. Please try again.

Then re-ask the step selection question via AskUserQuestion.

### 4. Handle existing artifacts (smart hybrid confirmation)

Read the JSON output. If `steps_with_artifacts` is **non-empty**, use AskUserQuestion:

**Some prerequisite steps already have output from a previous run. Re-use existing artifacts or re-run?**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Re-use existing artifacts (Recommended) | Skip completed prerequisites and only run what's missing |
| Re-run all steps | Discard existing output and re-run everything from scratch |

If `steps_with_artifacts` is **empty**, skip this question and run all steps.

### 5. Evaluate `when` conditions

For each step in the execution plan with a `when` field:

- `when: has_source_repo` — skip this step if no source repo or PR URL was provided. Log: "Skipping \<step\>: no source repository configured."
- `when: create_jira_project` — skip this step if create-jira was not selected. Log: "Skipping \<step\>: JIRA creation not requested."

### 6. Run steps sequentially

For each step in `execution_plan` order:

1. If `has_artifacts: true` AND user chose "Re-use existing artifacts" → skip with message: "Skipping \<step\>: using existing artifacts at \<base-path\>/\<step\>/"
2. If `when` condition is not met → skip with message (see above)
3. Otherwise, construct the args and invoke:

```
Skill: <step.skill>, args: "<ticket> --base-path <BASE_PATH> <step-specific-flags>"
```

**Step-specific flags** — each step gets `<ticket> --base-path <BASE_PATH>` plus:

| Step | Additional flags from collected config |
|------|---------------------------------------|
| requirements | `[--pr <url>]...` |
| planning | _(none)_ |
| code-evidence | `--repo <repo_path> [--scope-include <globs>] [--scope-exclude <globs>]` |
| prepare-branch | `[--draft] [--repo-path <path>]` |
| writing | `--format <adoc\|mkdocs> [--draft] [--repo-path <path>]` |
| style-review | `--format <adoc\|mkdocs>` |
| technical-review | _(none)_ |
| commit | `[--draft] [--repo-path <path>]` |
| create-mr | `[--draft] [--repo-path <path>]` |
| create-jira | `--project <PROJECT>` |

The format flag defaults to `adoc` unless the user selected Material for MkDocs.

### 7. Verify and report

After each step completes:

1. Check the step's output directory exists at `<BASE_PATH>/<step-name>/`
2. If missing, report the failure: "Step \<step\> failed — expected output at \<path\> not found." **STOP** — do not continue to subsequent steps.
3. If present, report success: "Step \<step\> completed. Output: \<path\>"

After all steps complete, display a summary:

> **Completed steps:**
> - requirements: artifacts/proj-123/requirements/
> - planning: artifacts/proj-123/planning/
> - writing: artifacts/proj-123/writing/
>
> **Skipped steps:**
> - code-evidence: no source repository configured
